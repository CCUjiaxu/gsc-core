Welcome to GSC’ official GitHub repository. The code is still in its early stages and is under constant change to improve its quality and functionality.

## How to Contribute

If you have a reasonable understanding of blockchain technology and at least some notions of Java you can of course 
contribute by using GitHub issues and Pull Requests. We also appreciate other types of contributions such as 
documentation improvements or even correcting typos in the code if you spot any.

The standard procedure is well documented on GitHub, for detailed explanation, especially if it’s the first time you’re 
doing this, you can follow the procedure on the following links:
[Working with forks](https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-forks/) and 
[Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/).
Basically, you fork the GSC repository, create a branch that clearly indicates the problem you’re solving. Later, when 
you are happy with your work, you create a Pull Request so we can review and discuss your implementation.

If the problem needs debating or you have questions on how to implement a feature, we would prefer you open a GitHub 
[issue](https://github.com/gscsocial/gsc-core/issues). If you spotted a typo or a code formatting issue, just directly 
opening a Pull Request is fine.
